kütüphane listeleme ve dosyalama
A program on library listing and filing
It is one of my educational projects.
In this project, there is an authorization level that firstly questions whether you are a student or an employee.
First, the member and book information stored in the .txt file will be read from the file and transferred to the series and all information will be stored in these series. Next, users will complete the process of registering or logging in. Depending on whether it is a student or an employee logging into the system, 2 different menus will be presented. All the above-mentioned settings must be made in this menu, the menu is operated continuously as long as the user does not key in 'Q'.
